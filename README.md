## 📌 Overview

**ToDoux** is a **very simple to-do app built with SwiftUI**, created for the sole purpose of:

✅ Practicing `@State` and `@Binding` management in SwiftUI  
✅ Manipulating simple `List`, `Sheet`, and `Button` interactions  
✅ Experimenting with basic UI layouts, color management, and SwiftUI structuring

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was **intentionally kept simple** and **not pushed towards a production-ready app**.

Its goals:

- Strengthen SwiftUI fundamentals in a clean, focused environment
- Test adding, toggling, and deleting items using `List`
- Implement a minimal `sheet` to add new tasks with basic input
- Play with colors, layout responsiveness, and simple user interactions

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Add new tasks via a `sheet`  
✅ Display tasks in a `List` with checkable completion status  
✅ Swipe-to-delete tasks easily  
✅ Simple, colorful UI for practice and readability

---

## 🤔 Why This Project?

> **“I built ToDoux to reinforce my SwiftUI fundamentals with a real, tiny app without the pressure of polish, networking, or advanced architecture.”**

If you are looking for:

✅ Clean `State` management practice  
✅ SwiftUI `List` usage  
✅ Simple `sheet` and `dismiss` pattern  
✅ Lightweight and understandable SwiftUI layout experimentation

Then this project is a **solid, clean reference**.
